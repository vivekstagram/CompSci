 * Name: Vivek Patel

 * Purpose: Write a modified version of the selection sort algorithm that selects the largest element
			each time and moves it to the end of the array, rather than selecting the smallest element
			and moving it to the beginning. Will this algorithm be faster than the standard selection
			sort? What will its complexity class (big-O) be? (BJP Ch 13 Ex 8)
